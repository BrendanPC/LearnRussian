# LearnRussian

A simple Chrome extension to help me extend my Russian vocabulary. The extension swaps English nouns on a webpage with their Russian equivalents. Clicking the Extension popup buttons brings up a dictionary with all the relevants words on the current page.

## Possible future development

* ~~Ability to blacklist websites or temporarily disable the extension would be really useful.~~

* ~~Deal with multiple English words getting flattened into a single Russian word (e.g. head/mind/brains -> голова)~~

* ~~Maintain capitalization after translation.~~

* Some way of automatically extending the available dictionary - perhaps allowing the user to do so.

* ~~Show the gender of words in the Reference dictionary. This information already exists in dictionary.txt.~~

* ~~Right-click to see translation, for quicker help than checking the dictionary.~~

* Very easily altered to support other languages - simply edit dictionary.js.

* Click in dictionary to get more info, e.g. get a pronunciation audio clip, word conjugations, etc.

* Click in dictionary to highlight words on page / click on page to highlight in dictionary
