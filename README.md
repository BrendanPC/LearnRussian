# LearnRussian

A simple Chrome extension to help me extend my Russian vocabulary. The extension swaps English nouns on a webpage with their Russian equivalents. Clicking the Extension popup buttons brings up a dictionary with all the relevants words on the current page.

## Possible future development

* Ability to blacklist websites or temporarily disable the extension would be really useful.

* Deal with multiple English words getting flattened into a single Russian word (e.g. head/mind/brains -> голова)

* Deal with English words that have multiple translations available (e.g. time -> время/раз/час/срок)

* Limit/randomize number of words swapped - can be overwhelming if dictionary has hundreds of entries.

* Maintain capitalization after translation.

* Some way of automatically extending the available dictionary. Google Translate API is paywalled though. :'(

* Show the gender of words in the Reference dictionary. This information already exists in dictionary.txt.

* Hover to see translation, for quicker help than checking the dictionary.

* Very easily altered to support other languages - simply edit dictionary.js.
